velocity and density models:
nz= 335
nx=1467
dz=dx=7.5 m

receiver_*: elastic-wave sensitivity energies along the receiver line

rec_1.txt: receiver locations x, z; 1467 locations
src_1.txt: source locations x, z, and fc (center frequency); 146 sources

d_rec=7.5 m
d_src=75 m

mask leakage
values: 0=baseline, 1=leakage

receiver - sensitivity at receivers (surface receiver line)
all - sensitivity on 2D grid
