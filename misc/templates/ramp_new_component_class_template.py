New component model class is supposed to be placed in the folder src/ramp/components.

Some IDEs allow for tabs to be automatically replaced by 4 spaces if you indicate
it in your IDE preferences. In situations other than that please don't use tabs
for indentation but rather 4 spaces.

If you do use this template, at the end of development please remove not relevant

        # of model results keyed by distinct observation names. In general,
